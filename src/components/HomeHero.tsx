                        The following page has been created by me over the last weekend of October, 2025, for the purposes of showcasing my work - it's a portfolio, of sorts. It has lately become clear to me, that such "creative canvas" is quite necessary, given its my dream (objective) to pursue a creative career - one, where I create something new, instead of repetitively recreating something already-established. I hereby welcome you again, and hope for your wish to read on.
