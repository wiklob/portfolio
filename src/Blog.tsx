                    When to Trust a principle, and the upsides of questioning it.

                <div className="blog-post-text">
The Dynamic — a creative approach discovering the frontier peripheries of established (equilibralised) reality, that positions itself against the future rather than the past — considers questioning principles as its foundational concept. After all, principles are nothing but simplified core ideals squeezed into a one-liner, that many believe to be true. Given the Creative rebels, start-uppers, and other followers of the Dynamic form a community, by definition there are also some majorities amongst them; unavoidably, even the anti-principle field has its principles. Analysing various stances one may take towards them and their consequences are the topic of this essay.

<b>Initial validation of principles, Trusting </b>
<br /><br />
Having defined a principle as “a simple truth believed by most”, the word believed shall be acknowledged as the most complex of words making up this definition. Setting aside the subject’s awareness of development and acquiring such devotion, one may be prompted towards believing either by insufficient or profound experience in a specific field. Both manners are just as valid to support principle formation, but carry different consequences when analysed on an individual basis.
<br /><br />
What is crucial to this analysis, is sensitivity to Creator’s development process. Arguably, Creators are even less predicable than their Creations, considering that self-development agility is their core feature (virtue). Measurement systems, in the form of funding round sizes, MRRs, or even tik-tok followers, do exist — but their inherent imperfectness deriving from the Dynamic of the field needn’t be pointed to anyone familiar with such hustle, especially as most of them exist for marketing or business prosperity purposes. Furthermore, such progress neither follows any preset route, nor it is single-threaded; different capabilities are comprised of features spanning from personality traits, technical skills, knowledge or soft competences. Effectively, sensitivity to the Creator’s development process requires awareness of its lengthiness over time1. Given predictable positive correlation between experience and development progress (with former somewhat essential to the latter), the analysis objective may be narrowed down: Creator’s positioning towards principles will vary depending on his advancement as a Creator, and so will feasibility/adequacy of specific stances.
<br /><br />
<i>The author of this essay considers himself a rather inexperienced (beginner) Creator; the analysis will therefore focus on the process of entry to the Dynamic field, and only hypothesise about later-coming forms.</i>
<br /><br />
Initial validation stage, a period preceding Creator’s experience gain in the field of concern to the principle, involves Trusting as the default warranted relationship. Said Trusting shall not be understood as “a firm belief in truthfulness”, but rather “acknowledging without investigation”. This correctness presumption must not render conviction towards a principle as something declarative (feasibility of abrupt introduction being followed by axiom-like treatment, and the perfect performance deriving from it). The opposite reasoning, where devotion is a skill that one may gradually progress at, seems way closer to being true. This seemingly unfortunate cognitive error (declarative Trusting) is actually the essence of why Trusting works — it creates a carefree opportunity for obsession-based development by postponing complexities to a later stage of progress, allowing the Creator to gain a Creative foothold.
<br /><br />
Applicability (adequacy) of Trusting, assessed in line with the previous paragraph, will vary depending on the principle it is being applied towards. We will precede our reasoning with examples, to counterbalance the theoretical spirit of the analysis so far.
<br /><br />
<b>Example 1: “Start now”, “Start with a crude version of the product”, “and iterate quickly”</b>
<br /><br />
These three seemingly separate phrases showcase only one principle of starting quickly2, with varying complexity to different stages of Creation; first states the principle straight forward, the second one extends its applicability to the MVP (Minimum Viable Product3), and the last presents starting quickly as a foundation for a larger framework.
<br /><br />
Highlighting differences between perception of respective phrases shall somewhat compensate for not necessarily the most clarifying narrative choice of bringing three examples into one. “Starting now”, after all, is in fact very crude phrasing of starting quickly — and Trusting this advice requires just acting immediately. There is no prerequisites to starting: just sit down and take the shortest path to get where you want. Additionally, starting now implies delivering (some) results quickly. We can therefore name “Start now” as a great example of the principle one can Trust, because it is a) straight forward, b) executable immediately c) validated quickly.
<br /><br />
This example must include a digression regarding an especially critical word, “just”. Just, one could say, disregards many layers of “arguments” opposing taking action — but this is exactly the point of Trusting, of this principle, and of this essay; analysing multiple common doubts against acting, is not.4
<br /><br />
Looking into the next advice of “Starting with a crude version of the product” — from the perspective of a beginner, this statement is not equally easy to Trust immediately as the former. That’s not due to already put-aside doubts, but because of the knowledge being necessary to imagine what is a product, and how does its relatively crude version look like. When one follows the primary phrasing of the principle, though, he will soon acquire necessary5 understanding, that will make “starting with a crude version” more straight forward.
<br /><br />
As the Creator reaches the MVP, “iterating quickly” will clarify itself soon enough; while requiring a whole framework, that includes testing, feedback, corrections, briefings, and redeploys, the starting quickly principle will nevertheless prevail true throughout it. Again — both the concept and the practical dimension of “iterating quickly” would be somewhat mysterious to an entrant, but Trusting the underlying principle will eventually clarify this concept too.
<br /><br />
As showcased by the example one, sometimes small principles can have one, underlying principle. The further from direct action (more complex) the phrasing is, the less believable it seems from the beginners perspective, hence Trusting it on the spot can prove harder. Trusting complex principles is not immediately necessary.
<br /><br />
<b>Example 2: “Choose problems, that actually need to be solved”</b>
<br /><br />
This principle reflects on the importance of market validation (demand) for our solution (Creation) answering a problem of our choice. This principle (simplified one-liner ideal) has a very complex nature — optimising for the essential message of “Choose the right problems”, it inverts the chronology of Creation. Instead of Problem (Inspiration) → Solution (Creation) → Validation (Demand), it requires reliance on one’s experience and predictions to correctly assess Demand, find its underlying Problem, and then conceptualise a Creation answering both.
<br /><br />
This principle, although a paraphrase of the great Paul Graham (just as all from the previous example6), is not an easy one to put Trust in. It is complex, involves assessment of predicted, conditional, and multi-factor phenomenons. It is not at all straight forward, and one can neither execute it, nor personally validate it quickly — it is not suitable to be immediately Trusted by a beginner.
<br /><br />
The Example 2 described a complex principle, that is therefore not so easy to Trust; furthermore, premature Trusting can result in increased doubts or grievances, or shame as a feeling of not deserving in case of a success. Not Trusting, on the other hand, neither means absolute absence of Trust nor Anti-Trusting (a separate phenomenon) — rather, it implies presence of some suspiciousness and uncertainty regarding righteousness of the principle. In principle (!), both those feelings are generally warranted.
<br /><br />
From here on, this essay enters the earlier-announced phase of less strict reasoning. To better understand the Conservative and the Dynamic, check out the previous essay.
<br /><br />
<b>Anti-Trusting</b>
<br /><br />
Anti-Trusting is sort of a Creative quirk; after all, trusting, that Trusting (taking for true) a principle is wrong, is also a form of Trusting — Anti-Trusting. What follows, is building a framework around such Anti-Trusting stance, that is deviated in some way from what the Principled Consensus (the set of main underlying principles of Creation in the Dynamic field) suggests.
<br /><br />
The issue with such approach is related to the characteristics of the Dynamic field. Principles forming the Principled Consensus, contrary to their Conservative counterparts, are not tied to any True State, because it does not exist. Furthermore, the existence of the Dynamic is enabled by capability of perception broadening, and recursive rendering additional, “more ambitious” levels of the Dynamic. Effectively, even if some of the principles in the Dynamic are mutually contradictory, it isn’t very much bothering7 — when there is no True State, everything may seem… Dynamically-True.
<br /><br />
<i>Dynamic Truth shall return during next essays; it lays potential on explaining the above-average fab/vibe/mood/aesthetic susceptibility of the Dynamic Field of Startups and its absurdities — inflated funding rounds of nothing, MRRs based on free trials, the tech Twitter (oh gosh), and so on. Apparently, the detachment of the Dynamic from the truth, its foundational concept thanks to which it rises to its greatness, also has downsides. Who would have thought.</i>
<br /><br />
Nevertheless, the impact on the Anti-Trusting is profound: thanks to better Creative framework (namely iterative development scheme, direct feedbacks, and improvement focus) make the Principled Consensus of the Dynamic Field way more relevant, and just generally better than usual common principles. Effectively, Anti-Trusting is somewhat doomed to fail.
<br /><br />
And yet, it is absolutely crucial that it persists, and the Creators keep trying. This not only tempers the Creators, but also the Dynamic Field itself too! So, yes, an absolute beginner probably won’t overturn the consensus. And, no, it is probably not a good idea to disobey all principles, and probably it is not very healthy in the long run to be motivated negatively, i.e. to do stuff in order to prove something wrong.
<br /><br />
But the whole industry has risen to greatness specifically thanks to this rebelliousness, specifically because of willingness to test out this “probably” — and Creators also get better and better, each time they try and fail. It doesn’t matter whether you agree or disagree with a principle, or with this essay for that matter, as long as you go out there, and do what you believe in.
<br /><br />
Good luck.
<br /><br />
<b> Following</b>
<br /><br />
Having made the headline, Following is a rather complimentary to the Trust. Not that it is any less interesting; after all, Creator’s relationship with a principle, whether its perpetuated spiritual devotion, periodic love-hate relationship or a redemption journey, is often the core driver of the Creative Process itself. Unfortunately, its organised nature renders it less sexy to discuss.
<br /><br />
It does not make it an obsolete concept, though. Following a principle is a natural evolution of either Trusting or Anti-Trusting it — the introduction provided by aforementioned stances feeds the Creator with experience and understanding of the environment the principle operates in. Creator can then begin assimilating his workflow to the principle, and in turn also accustom the principle to his workflow — maybe develop an industry complexity, or just change the phrasing, as one word is suddenly deemed underestimated by the industry.8
<br /><br />
It was Author’s every intent to write more about following principles. Unfortunately, each of the approaches taken to deliberate on following principles felt numb. Maybe it’s because of lack of Experience, or it’s just boring. Or rather, that positioning towards principles is a gradually more personal experience; hence talking about it universally doesn’t feel approachable. Either way — stick to your guns, start now and don’t stop Creating. And always, always dare to question principles. If you can’t validate them anytime, they will inevitably fail in less favourable circumstances.
<br /><br />

This emphasis is the main point of the paragraph; while could’ve been avoided, it has been nevertheless left in the essay because of its not so obvious character. When discussing activities in the Dynamic, one could presume emphasis shifted towards efficiency rather than polite processing/performative working; valuing effects over buildup, now over before. Thus, this paragraph intended to reemphasise the time dimension of “experience” (not only as “amount of experience” in a strictly result-measuring manner), because Creators are discussed from the first person perspective. Reason for that being respect towards creator’s creative freedom regarding designing himself — but that shall remain for another essay.
<br /><br />

All these phrasings of a principle are paraphrases of principles dictated by Paul Graham: “Here it is: I like to find (a) simple solutions (b) to overlooked problems (c) that actually need to be solved, and (d) deliver them as informally as possible, (e) starting with a very crude version 1, then (f) iterating rapidly.” It has been quoted by Y Combinator in a Tweet on 4th of October, 2025; Author thanks both aforementioned contributors (and personally looks up to them greatly), but has no intent of finding specific URLs to quoted words.
<br /><br />

In the essays, the Author attempts to explain most abbreviations, even those considered obvious in the start-up “industry”, so that the articles are accessible also to new readers. I had to look it up after one of my first meetings myself!
<br /><br />
4
This topic requires more sensibility and understanding than the phrasing of this paragraph, and deserves a separate article — one of a different message.
<br /><br />
5
Here we mention “necessary” understanding, even though earlier we argued about belief being present in absence of understanding. While such reasoning is in principle (!) true, in the example we have to account for the unavoidably present doubts and offset them with such very basic understanding (do not mistake understanding for Understanding).
<br /><br />

See Footnote 2.
<br /><br />
7
That being said, contradictions between Conservative principles are 1000 times more notorious.
<br /><br />
8
It shall be noted, though, that there is way less pressure towards differentiation than in a Conservative field: while the professors on the television sometimes “unfortunately have to agree”, the Dynamic Field’s leaders often praise their peers, and those who inspired them. When disagreement with the consensus is the default, agreeing with someone doesn’t take away from one’s character (instead making a nice compliment).

Creation comes from inspiration - a subjective reinterpretation of a given up to the point, where one discovers something bothering about it. It may be then said, that new comes into being under some specific impression of old, making the inspiration either conservative (both positive and negative) or independent, dynamic. Ultimately, they provide for a foundation of development frameworks. Cognitive consequences deriving from either, their suitability to different fields and switching between them, are the topic of this essay.
<br /><br />
<b> The Conservative Inspiration</b>
<br /><br />
It shall be acknowledged, that the Conservative Inspiration (CI) is the default for most. It is instilled during the course of regular education through the establishment of Points of Reference (PoR); historical figures, events or circumstances provide the theoretical reference, while the teacher himself may become one on the interpersonal level. For many, such PoRs later develop towards a straight-forward CI process: one positions a specific PoR towards his relevant experiences, and modules his opinion after it. Positive CI will then appreciate the PoR and create through furthering or contextualizing such reasoning, while a negative CI will oppose its PoR and prompt creation via structured disagreement.
<br /><br />
Such reasoning brings us to notice, that CI binds the Creation (the effect of the creative process) to its PoR, with the former built in comparative connection to the latter; such link may remain in the subconscious of the Author or be fully embraced by the Creation, but nevertheless, it will carry some imperfections (e.g. biases or emphases distribution) from the PoR to the Creation.
<br /><br />
Furthermore, such PoR always chronologically precedes the Creation. This condition negatively influences the capability of independent inspiration, and builds a streamlined inspiration framework based on CIs, where the subject achieves further milestones laid down by predecessors, that came to be his PoRs.
<br /><br />
CI-based formative process is highly efficient in monosemic (rigidly designated) fields, where exactly one True State (TS) exists, and discovering more Temporary truths (true till disproven) shall strive to come closer to understanding it. It seems true only in theory, though — in practice, bound by inherent CI’s bias towards obtaining certainty, Temporary truths falsely pose as the TS. An example from the semantic substrate: physics is a signified domain (exploring definitive structure and translating the order of pre-existing meanings), but physicists are biased towards operating in a signifying (discovering facts and creating new meaning order) manner1. Effectively, a longer chain of CI-led research will progress in line with the preset consensus, but straying away from the TS. It is then the technological advances and enhancements in data collection methods, that every so often allow a disruptor to come around; he then questions the consensus enough to disprove one of its fundamentals, and overturns its falsely True State. What is later labeled as a breakthrough, shall rather be called a break-in — bringing a real Truth from outside of the consensus into it. In a vague interpretation, the rise of quantum mechanics in the early 20th century showcases this process2.
<br /><br />
<b>The Exit and the Extraterrestrial Inspiration</b>
<br /><br />
Operating (performing a series of creative processes) in the CI framework builds specific loyalties towards CI-prominent ideals. Most notably: respect towards peers and the TS, responsibility for one’s Creation before the audience, designation of the canon creators and the outliers, and humility; all of them derive from the axiom of positioning against a PoR. Prolonged exposure to such environment inevitably changes one’s creative capabilities through adaptation to a confirmation-driven development environment. In such, the subject builds in relation to a preexisting consensus (PoR) supplied by gathered evidence, and if the reasoning is deemed valid (conducted in line with best practices), external validator issues an acknowledgement of value. This approach is sufficient for a monosemic (one True State) field, and may deliver significant progress overtime.
<br /><br />
It may so happen, that one encounters an incentive to leave such domain (the Exit). This Extraterrestrial3 Inspiration (EI) is often accompanied by a strong emotion or feeling, that suddenly allows the subject to “zoom out” — the monosemic paradigm then becomes just a part of a broader, polysemic one, where the previous TS is rendered as just another Temporary truth. The Exit is not a single moment, but a process; to progress towards the Dynamic, fundamental changes to the cognition, inspiration and creation processes are required.
<br /><br />
The reason for that comes directly from the definition of the Dynamic — a field with no True State, existing on the periphery of the default Conservative field, often towards its avant-garde. Given the absence of the TS, we can no longer operate through CI and uncover it, we can’t prove it right. Effectively, the confirmation-driven development cannot take place, and the CI’s inspiration-feedback loop delivering the result on the end of a cycle falls apart. The Conservative framework doesn’t work anymore.
<br /><br />
The mechanics of the Dynamic field are the inversion of the Conservative field. Instead of observing, and quantifying or determining features of the TS, we imagine our Extraterrestrial Inspiration materializing (the Creation), and bend the circumstances towards that. Fundamentally, we strip our ultimate PoR (the True State in the CI’s case) from its illusion of absolute trueness, and then shift it in time — from the past, to the future.
<br /><br />
Bending the circumstances must begin with an Attempt (contrary to the CI, the EI doesn’t have the comfort of building on previous findings). Such Attempt — or, for that matter, any attempt — brings the creation process closer to the Creation. Creator shall acknowledge that at the first feedback round, which measures the progress in reference to the PoR. Given he has moved our PoR into the future, though, what begins is the malfunction-driven development; the new iteration doesn’t position itself as one better than the previous one, but rather worse than the next one. Therefore in the EI framework, the increment begins with the feedback round outlining malfunctions/insufficiencies, and progresses towards reaching the neutral state without them.
<br /><br />
<b>Why to start now</b>
<br /><br />
The Exit and the Entry that follows are two never-completed challenges, reflecting the never-certain nature of the Dynamic field. On the other hand, abandoning the Conservative Inspirations completely is neither possible, nor optimal — there is some degree of knowledge one may possess conventionally, by just reading a book. The issue is, that the Extraterrestrial Inspiration starts with one vision, giving a finite amount of motivation; if it is fully devoted towards preparations, it probably won’t last to break through the conventional framework (CI), resulting in performativeness, and not performance.
<br /><br />
Additionally, aside from all new challenges incoming directly from the Dynamic field, the gravity of the Conservative field won’t let go immediately. While the specifics of such force deserve a separate article, a brief explanation of its existence comes from the definition of our Point of Reference; if the Extraterrestrial Inspiration has successfully moved it forward in time (to the future), then we shall become more concerned about the time in front of us, instead of the one behind us, in order to escape that gravity4.
<br /><br />
<i> The following paragraphs touch on more recent reflections of the author, effectively making them more subjective and personal than the rest of this text.</i>
<br /><br />
This relates to one of many principles of the Startup world — a prime example of a Dynamic field — “always start early”. Such guidance (not guidelines) correctly hints, that a set of principles on how to defy the principles does in fact exist. Following them immediately upon entry is quite hard, though, as it requires personality changes. Some new approaches must be introduced, while others removed, even if they reflect the same virtue (e.g.: rooting out risk averse doesn’t imply learning risk tolerance).
<br /><br />
Sometimes, trusting just one principle will bring in a complex approach revamp; “starting early” inherently means “starting weak and unprepared”, teaching the risk tolerance. Dealing with that problem will require seeking advice, what will then create a feedback loop, and that will introduce iterative enhancement… and so on.
<br /><br />
While the journey described in this essay is applicable to a startup, the Creation, its main point is about the Creator. There is one important difference between them, that doesn’t make the Creator just another Creation: the lifespan. While the latter seem immortal in principle, in practice they just come and go multiple times throughout the Creator’s career — and it is their raison d’être. If our best attempt isn’t enough to disprove the preexisting True state’s monopoly on truth, then such venture just comes to an end; if the Creator is proven wrong by the reality… nothing happens.
<br /><br />
Do I fear being seen as the one who talks much, and does little, because of writing such essay without extensive startup experience? Kinda. Do I feel like I spent too much time writing it? Maybe. Have I followed the advice from two paragraphs before? I wish I did.
<br /><br />
But one I know for sure: just now, through writing this article, I started. And so shall you.
<br /><br />
Start now.
<br /><br />

What may serve as the confirmation of this thesis, is that I myself have fallen back to the Conservative Inspiration to bring up that semantic interpretation. To pay tribute where its due: terms were somewhat familiar to me through “Ekonomia to stan umysłu” of Andrzej Leder (I should finally read it in full), who there used the terminology of de Saussure and his structural linguistics (as Claude has reminded me). Nevertheless, we arrive at another hypothesis: when we forward our curiosity too far beyond our expertise, and through that bridge the Dunning-Kruger, we may retreat from unawareness-fueled courageous exploration towards “established sources”. In my personal view: they prove quite useful at times, but become a pitfall if performed too often.
<br /><br />

Reader finding some other example more relevant is a delight to the author, regardless of whether the example provided made for a positive or negative inspiration towards it.
<br /><br />
3
From many phrasings available, the author chose “Extraterrestrial” as a signifier of something extremely external and extraordinary, trying to avoid supernatural or emotional nomenclature. It doesn’t have anything to do with aliens… or does it?
<br /><br />
4
There are only few phenomenons equally detrimental to world’s spirit than counting time with the reference in the past — even though what passed is just as not-present as the future. That being said, the other option, namely a countdown, also feels quite damning.
