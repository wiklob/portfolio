>Backstory

Poland, 2010 - I only recently learned to speak, and winters are still cold and snowy. As we near Christmas, we embark on a hour-long drive out of my hometown, to our countryside home; after all, there is nothing cooler than chasing down Santa through your own garden, however improbable was succeeding in it for a four-year-old. While we have prepared and brought most of our Christmas Table food with us, we needed to get fresh bread and preferred to source *kiełbasa* (sausage) locally. But how to get those products in -20 degrees Celcius, with the communal village shop closed down for winter?

The (rural) district's council had a solution for that: twice a week, a "Sklep obwoźny" ("Mobile Store") came over: a small van with groceries and other necessities. After making its way into a comfortable place somewhere in the middle of the village, it expected customers to come over by themselves, and buy what they need - and so everyone did, me and my family included. Fortunately or not, this practice has been abandoned (in my area at least) around 2012, as the communal shop has transformed into a private-ran business, suddenly affordable also during winter-time (capitalism ig). Twelve years have passed, until I recalled this particular concept from my childhood... and in the meantime Poland changed so much, that in my belief we made a full circle: once again in need of experiencing stuff personally. And Mobile Stores *may* be one of the answers.

Despite starting the text with the concept's backstory, I started my reasoning from a very different standpoint, and came across this similarity only by mistake. Namely: after approaching a few of very cool ideas that felt unachievable for that old me (I know no such concept anymore), I wanted to go with something simple to the core, so I can actually get it done - and I settled for a simple t-shirt store. Knowing my unwillingness to start a business without any innovation, one can rightly presume my focus: coming up with something, anything, that will make a boring business sexy. 

The following parts of the business have been named: merchandise, sales, advertisement, management - and each of those has received some twist over the early period of conceptualising.

>>Merchandise
Differenciation is the core tool of coolness, and goodness (social reflection) is not only the core evaluator of long-time sustainability, but happens to serve as great marketing, if spinned properly. Therefore, our merchandise has acquired few priorities: 
a) substantial portion of revenue should go towards charitable causes, so that helping can become both a motivation and a benefit (imagine a scarf with LV monograms, but printing each monogram is $10 towards animal protection). 
b) the whole chain should be under control of the company - from sustainable material sourcing and production up to Rimowa-like warranty policies
c) given there is more way too many t-shirts produced already, the brand may literally become its logo, nothing else: aside from buying a t-shirt, you can bring over your own t-shirt, and LITERALLY pay for the logo - stamped or printed in the store, just aside you. Imagine the rich people coming over with their designer brands, so that they can get a charity stamp for us.
d) we basically play 'sustainability' card better than anyone else. Production down, waste down (and properly utilised), helping up.
The final argument for this concept is supported by GreenPeace or WWF - they are asking for money, and giving nothing in return, because "helping should be voluntary". Bullshit. Images with dying animals or sticking to the road is just gross and annoying. Helping should be cool and become a symbol of status, or as one would say nowadays: Make Helping Great Again.

Despite its beautiful bloom, Poland and its big cities remain utterly gray. Obviously, each city is WAY brighter, "western" one would say, than 20 years ago - but still, the cityscape remains dull. Or rather: when you go to the street, there is very few *weird* things you encounter. On the other hand, Poland remains a walkable (or even highly-walked) country. This, in my opinion, creates a re-opening for physical marketing, of all manners.
a) Conventional on-street marketing: Posters, Murals, Announcements. Poles are susceptible to beauty, and would appreciate marketing conducted with presumption different than "customers are idiots, we must yell about promotions very loud".
b) Live Marketing - f.e. hiring actors posing as models, who walk around the city in your collection - and a group of fake paparazzi around them. Simply dragging attention by being weird, unusual. Already spotted by me during a promotional campaign for Squid Game, seemed popular. All actions and performances *inside* a city, that gain you visibility through weirdness. Way too rarely exploited.
c) Static Physical Marketing, "the Fortnite Llama strategy" -
