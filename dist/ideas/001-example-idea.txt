The core idea came to me while procrastinating on my actual todos.
What if the app could just tell me what to do next?

The flow would work something like this: user opens app, sees
AI-suggested task order based on deadlines, energy levels, and
past completion patterns. Swipe right to accept, left to defer.

Key insight from talking to people: the pain isn't task management
itself - it's the cognitive load of deciding what to do next.
Every time you open a todo app, you're making micro-decisions
that drain willpower.

Technical approach:
- GPT-4 for understanding task context and dependencies
- Simple ML model trained on user's completion patterns
- Time-of-day and calendar integration for scheduling
- No manual priority setting - the system learns

MVP could be a Chrome extension that watches your existing todo
app (Todoist, Things, etc.) and suggests reordering. Lower barrier
to adoption than a full new app.

Open questions I haven't solved:
- Privacy concerns with AI reading all your tasks?
- Freemium vs one-time purchase?
- How to handle tasks with no clear deadline?
